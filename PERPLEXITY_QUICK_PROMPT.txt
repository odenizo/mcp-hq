QUICK PROMPT FOR PERPLEXITY:

Research the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server ecosystem and commit results directly to GitHub repo: odenizo/mcp-hq (branch: main)

TASKS:
1. Validate 15 servers in /catalog/inbox.yaml - find missing GitHub URLs marked [TBD] or [search-needed]
2. For each server document: GitHub URL, transport types (stdio/HTTP/SSE), auth model, maturity, stars, last commit
3. Discover 20+ additional production-ready MCP servers across categories: DevTools, Data, Infrastructure, Productivity, Security
4. Focus on HTTP/SSE transport support (critical for cloud deployment)
5. Check official sources: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers, GitHub topic: mcp-server

CREATE 3 FILES using GitHub tools:
- /catalog/research/mcp_ecosystem_analysis.md (comprehensive report)
- /catalog/inbox_validated.yaml (validated inbox with metadata)
- /catalog/research/http_servers_registry.yaml (HTTP/SSE servers only)

COMMIT with message:
"Research: Complete MCP server ecosystem analysis
- Validated all 15 inbox servers with verified URLs
- Discovered [N] additional production-ready servers
- Identified HTTP/SSE-capable servers for cloud deployment
Research by Perplexity AI on [DATE]"

QUALITY: ✅ All inbox URLs verified ✅ 30+ servers total ✅ Transport types confirmed ✅ Sources cited ✅ Files committed to repo
